# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: The overall objective of my research is to develop molecular models, complemented by rheological and scattering experiments, in order to build predictive tools aimed at linking molecular structure to flow, and eventually design novel materials with desired properties

interests:
  - Rheology of architecturally complex macromolecules: from mesoscopic modelling to processing
  - Fundamental questions about tube models
  - Statistical tools linking synthesis to chain architectures
  - Multiscale dynamics of supramolecular polymeric assemblies
